DevOps has emerged as a solution. DevOps is a development methodology that closes the gap between development and operations teams emphasizing collaboration, automation, and continuous practices. It provides many important benefits including enhanced software delivery performance and increased team engagement. Even though the concept of DevOps has been discussed for a long time it is still challenging to adopt DevOps in software development organizations and many of them are trying to implement DevOps practices but stuck in middle due to various reasons such as cultural barriers, lack of expertise and organizational silos.
